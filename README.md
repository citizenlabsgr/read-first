# Mission

Citizen Labs works together with our entire community to promote transparency, better understand problems, and support informed decisions. We apply open data and open source technology, convene civic volunteers, and engage community guideership to create data-driven solutions.

### Citizen Movement?

Our volunteer community runs and drives all Citizen Labs projects! We **highly** encourage all to become involved and contribute. We believe from our neighborhoods to our cities there's always more room for improvement. Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!

### Project Roles
You've probably noticed that there are a few people in every active project taking questions, and helping new folks get settled in. Project guides, ambassadors, and maintainers create value by deeply understanding the project and helping volunteers to get the most out of volunteering. You don't need to be super technical, just organized and enthusiastic!

Below are the descriptions of these common roles:

* [Guide](guide-role-description.md)
