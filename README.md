# Mission

Citizen Labs works together with our entire community to promote transparency, better understand problems, and support informed decisions. We apply open data and open source technology, convene civic volunteers, and engage community leadership to create data-driven solutions.

## Citizen Movement?

Our volunteer community runs and drives all Citizen Labs projects! We **highly** encourage all to become involved and contribute. We believe from our neighborhoods to our cities there's always more room for improvement. Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!

### Storytelling
All of our projects are doing some interesting data gathering and analysis that we regularly share with the world [on our blog](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy), our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKPgMFPkopC30c-jrabzoMw), and the [Partially Derivative podcast](http://partiallyderivative.com) ([for example](http://partiallyderivative.com/podcast/2017/03/21/robot-bartender-overlords)). If you'd like to help with this, ping @lillianj in Slack!  

### Infrastructure and IT administration
We're doing this on a per-project basis. Connect with @jacebrowning to dive in further.5432

### Matchmaker
The community has grown to a point where there is a lot of activity and a steady stream of new volunteers, which is awesome! We could use more people who know about the various projects that are happening along with the skills of the incoming volunteers, and can both match people to projects (ideally, to specific tasks), along with routinely surfacing new opportunities to the broader community for folks to get involved at all skill levels. Ping @gecky in Slack if this sounds like fun to you!

### Project Leads
You've probably noticed that there are a few people in every active project keeping the group on track, taking questions, and helping new folks get settled in -- that's by design. Leading a project can be a big time commitment, but it's hugely valuable to making sure we're doing useful work, and volunteers are getting the most out of volunteering. You don't need to be super technical, just organized and enthusiastic! Ping @jonathon in Slack if you're interested in leading a project.

## Active projects  
We have many projects going in our slack community. Below is a list of some of our more active projects that are actively seeking help.

### [Assemble](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/assemble)  
**Slack:** [#assemble](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/assemble/)

**Project Description:** Community working to build tools and infrastructure to enable the study of online communities and their characteristics. As we work through our own projects, our goal is to build a toolkit which takes care of common tasks so researchers do not have to reinvent the wheel with each new project.  

**Project Leads:** [@bstarling](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@bstarling/) [@nick](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@nick/)

### [Boston Crash Modeling](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/boston-crash-modeling)
**Project Description:** This is an official collaboration between the City of Boston's Analytics Team and Data for Democracy. We want to build a crash prediction modeling application. This would combine things like [our crowdsourced safety concerns dataset](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VZSafety/) and [crash reports](http://app01.cityofboston.gov/VisionZero/) with a wide range of other data from our own open data portal as well as from other sources like the state's transportation and transit agencies, weather conditions feeds, and traffic reports from sites like Google. The end result will be a set of dynamic predictions we can use to identify potential trouble spots and direct timely safety interventions--everything from protected bike lanes and better-marked crosswalks to new street lights and traffic light timings. We'll make this publicly-available to everyone through a hosted map application, and develop the project as an open source template that can be adapted for use by other cities.

**Slack:** [#boston-crash-modeling](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/boston-crash-modeling/)

**Project Leads:** [@therriault](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@therriault/) (City of Boston lead), [@niccolley](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@niccolley/) (Data for Democracy lead)

### [Grand Rapids Parks Project](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/drug-spending)  
**Slack:** [#drug-spending](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/drug-spending/)  
**Project Description:** Help the public understand what their tax dollars are going toward. Eg, what % of the eligible population (and/or all Americans) are benefiting from Medicare prescription drug coverage? How many Medicare enrollees are being treated for common/relatable conditions like diabetes, Alzheimer's, or depression? What proportion of Medicare prescription spending is on each of those conditions?

**Project Leads:** [@jenniferthompson](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@jenniferthompson/) [@mattgawarecki](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@mattgawarecki/)

**Data:** [data.world/data4democracy/drug-spending](https://data.world/data4democracy/drug-spending)

### [Open Budget Grand Rapids](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/election-transparency)  
**Slack:** [#election-transparency](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/election-transparency/)

**Project Description:** Aggregating and normalizing county-level election results to be shared with the broader community. This team now has a fantastic dataset that's difficult to obtain. In addition to the ongoing data engineering effort, they could use help from statisticians, political scientists, and anyone ready to analyze this data.

**Project Leads:** [@chris_dick](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/chris_dick/), [@scottcame](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/scottcame/), [@rachelanddata](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/rachelanddata/)

### [River Edge Design Guidelines](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/internal-displacement)

**Project Description:**  
Grouping for projects related to refugees. Our main current project involves classifying, tagging, analyzing and visualizing news events relating to internally displaced people in an attempt to track internal refugee crises across the globe.

**Slack:** [#refugees](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/refugees/)

**Project Lead:**
[@grichardson](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@grichardson/)

### [Open Data Regional Review](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/immigration-connect)
**Project Description:** Collecting, analyzing, and modeling data related to immigration. We're also building tools (visualizations, email parsers, matching algorithms to connect to connect pro bono lawyers with immigrants in need) to support the work of organizations working on immigration law and other immigration related issues.

**Slack:** [#immigration-connect](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/immigration-connect/)

**Project Leads:** [@tylerjrichards](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@tylerjrichards/) [@jtorrez](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@jtorrez/) [@chavan](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@chavan/)

### [Indivisible](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/indivisible)  
**Slack:** [#indivisible](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/indivisible/)

**Project Description:** A variety of civic activism organizations have sprung up in the wake of the election to help mobilize and empower people. The organizations often operate by sending out daily or weekly “actions” that their supporters partake in – whether calling a Member of Congress’s office, attending an event, or reading a key piece of information. This project we will build tools to
* Identify various actions available for users by aggregating different sources of data
* Provide a clean user interface to filter and select actions they are interested in
* Build a dashboard and track action progress/effectiveness over time
* Engage user interest through social media or similar means to identify tasks for more effective actions

**We need software and web developers**

**Project Leads:** [@pg](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@pg/) [@bonfiam](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/@bonfiam/)
