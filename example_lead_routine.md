_If you haven't yet, be sure to check out the [`read-this-first`](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first) repo and in particular the [lead role description](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first/blob/master/lead-role-description.md)._

You may find that using a predetermined process helps with consistency and saves precious cognitive energy for more doing and less thinking. This is meant to be an example and a starting point for anyone to take and revise to their heart's content. -@RyanEs

### Daily

* Respond to Slack mentions (`shift + command + m`)
* Check-in at the #leads channel 
* Check in with co-leads
* Check-in at your project channels
* Review project and team repos for comments and questions
* Review and merge pull requests 
* Give kudos and encouragement to folks who gave their time 

### Three Times a Week 

* Work on assigned issues 
* Catch up on other unread Slack channels 
* If you're all done, pick up an issue or two 

### Weekly 

* Ask: What are the next steps in each of our projects, if any? 
* Ask: Are there any interesting ideas I thought of that I need to document and share? 

### Monthly

* Ask: Is my lead routine *both* sustainable and helpful to others? If not, time to revise!
