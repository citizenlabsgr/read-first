# Project Lead
Some guidelines about creating and taking on the role of project lead.

## Role Description
The project lead is designed to be a single main point of contact for a project. They are responsible for coordinating the technical direction of a project and its team, and ensuring that it meets its goals. The tasks involved can range in scope, and can be as self-contained as asking for a specific formatting of data or as wide-ranging as hunting down entire datasets to be analyzed. Think of this role as equivalent to "Manager of Data Science" or "Lead/Senior Data Scientist".

Never done this before? Great! No previous experience require and the D4D is here to help out.

## Role Guidelines
### When does a project need a lead?
Some projects naturally require project leads from the outset - such as those with external partners - but not every project is created equal.

Other times, the need for a lead might emerge over time. Let's say you've been goofing around with your D4D buddies. Someone thought it would be interesting to try to collect and build a pipeline for *\<insert shiny data>*, and you hack something together. The project gains some real momentum and people start piling in to help. Maybe it's time for a leader.

### Responsibilities
Responsibilities that should be 

- Setting up a [project README](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first/blob/master/new-project-template.md)
- Coordinating the technical work of the team
- Managing list of project priorities
- Communicating the process
- Identifying tasks for people at various stages of analysis
- Act as point of contact
- Communicate with project Facilitator and Ambassador

Depending on the exact nature of the project, you might also want to include

- Formalizing a pull request review process


### GitHub Privilege
The project lead should have administrative level permissions on the GitHub repo.

### Selecting a project lead
For projects where an external partner is involved or with specific deliverables, leaders may be appointed by D4D.
